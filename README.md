# Library Management System

1. Created a JavaFX-based library management system with CRUD functionality using MySQL,
featuring book issuing and returning options.
2. Implemented empty field checking for issuing books and validation to ensure only issued books are
returned.
3. Applied suitable fines for late returns based on calculated return dates, ensuring efficient management.
